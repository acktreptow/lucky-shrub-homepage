# Lucky Shrub Homepage

Welcome to Lucky Shrub! Arizona's own garden design firm.

This was the first peer reviewed project I completed for Meta's Front-End Developer course. We were tasked with creating a homepage for one of 4 companies, and I decided to design the Lucky Shrub homepage as that seemed to be the least popular choice among my peers.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Overview

The initial project only required HTML & CSS, but I have since gone back and add some JavaScript functionality. I have also incorporated responsive design, which wasn't part of the specification.

Overall, this was a fun project that improved my HTML/CSS skills. Especially with flex-box, where I got to incorporate numerous ones, many of which are nested flex-boxes.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/lucky-shrub-homepage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd lucky-shrub-homepage`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Future Enhancements

I would like to add even more JavaScript functionality at someone point, but I am very happy with where it currently stands and so a lot of other projects will take priority.
