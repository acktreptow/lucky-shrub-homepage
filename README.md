# Lucky Shrub Homepage

Welcome to Lucky Shrub!

This was the first project I completed for Meta's Front-End Developer course. Tasked with creating a homepage for one of four companies, I decided on Lucky Shrub as that was the least popular choice among my peers.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Overview

The initial project only required HTML & CSS, but I have since gone back and added some JavaScript functionality.

I have also incorporated responsive design for good UX on phones and tablets, which wasn't part of Meta's specification.

Overall, this was a fun project that improved my HTML/CSS skills. Especially with flex-box, where I got to incorporate numerous nested ones.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (for Git): `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/lucky-shrub-homepage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd lucky-shrub-homepage`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser

## Future Enhancements

I would like to add even more JavaScript functionality at some point, but I am very happy with where it currently stands and so a lot of other projects will take priority.
